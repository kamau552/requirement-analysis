# Requirement-analysis in Software Development

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of Requirement Analysis, a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It covers key concepts, activities, types of requirements, diagrams, and criteria to help understand how software needs are gathered, analyzed, and validated.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product. It ensures that all software requirements are clearly defined and aligned with business goals before development begins. 

It plays a vital role in the SDLC by reducing ambiguities, avoiding rework, and ensuring all parties understand what the final product should achieve.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Alignment**: Ensures all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of system goals.
- **Risk Reduction**: Identifies and resolves potential issues early, reducing costly changes later.
- **Efficient Development**: Provides a solid foundation, enabling teams to design and build effectively.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Extracting the actual needs using interviews, surveys, and observation.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Writing requirements in a structured format for reference.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Reviewing, prioritizing, and modeling requirements (e.g., with diagrams).
- **Requirement Validation**: Confirming that requirements are complete, clear, and correct.


## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do.  
**Examples for Booking System:**
- Users can search for available bookings.
- Admin can update or cancel a booking.
- The system emails confirmation after checkout.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system should behave.  
**Examples for Booking System:**
- The system should load booking results in under 2 seconds.
- Must be available 99.9% of the time.
- Data should be encrypted during transmission.


## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams help visualize the interaction between users (actors) and the system. They are useful in identifying functional requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and acceptable.

**Example - Checkout Feature:**
- User must be logged in to check out.
- Booking summary must be shown before confirmation.
- Payment must be successful.
- Confirmation email must be sent after checkout.

These criteria ensure functionality aligns with user expectations and system design.
